I am writing this README about 4 years after I created this project. Uploading to github to preserve it and hopefully in the future work on it again

This project involves a simple game created in Untiy in which a Cube must avoid walls while constantly moving forward (think very very crude subway surfers, then get even cruder)
A nueral network using a simple genetic algorithm is then trained to play the game with configurable generation size, nueral network hidden layers, and mutation amount.

Running this project should be as simple as downloading the proper version of Unity (which Unity Hub will prompt you to do) Then running it in the IDE
